# Simulation-of-Life
Map-based simulation of animals' behavior. This program allows users to observe animals moving, feeding, and reproducing, while presenting statistical data through charts. The project was designed for the UST AGH object-oriented programming class.
## Game rules
- Animals have to move each day. The position change costs energy.
- Consuming grass allows gathering some energy for the future.
- A pair of animals on the same field can reproduce if sufficient resources are available.
- Way of moving is based on the parent's genome or random factors(Depending on which option is chosen).
